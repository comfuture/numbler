<h2>Welcome to Numbler web services</h2>
<p>Thanks for your interest in the Numbler web service API.  The goal of this guide is to help you get up and running with Numbler as quickly as possible!</p>
<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
<p>Hopefully at this point you have already checked out <a href="/">Numbler</a>, created a sheet or two, 
    and perhaps shared a sheet with some of your friends or coworkers.  While our first goal with Numbler was 
    to help people collaborate on a spreadsheets, and equally important goal is hooking up sheets with the rest of the 
    information on the web.</p>
      <div class="emph">This is where you fit in!</div>
  <p>If you are a developer we want to help you integrate your application or "mash-up" with Numbler.  We have developed a dead simple REST based API that enables your code to talk to a web based spreadsheet.  It's really simple to use some sample code to help you out you can start using Numbler with only a <b>couple of lines of code</b>.
