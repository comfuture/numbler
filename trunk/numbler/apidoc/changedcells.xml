<h3>Handling of modified cells</h3>
<p>Whenever a cell is added or deleted from the spreadsheet there is a chance that other cells 
  will be effected.  A good example would be a spreadsheet that performs a mortgage calculation: 
  if your program changes the interest rate the entire list of monthly payments will also change.
</p>
<p>By default, Numbler will return an XML document that contains all of the modified cells.  
  Most of the time we expect that this will be useful information.  In other cases, such as the interest rate example, 
  you may not care.  In this situation we support an additional argument to turn off changed cell 
  notifications; instead you will receive a count of the number of changed cells.
