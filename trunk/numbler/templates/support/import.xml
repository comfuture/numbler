  <item description="What import options does Numbler support?" ref="importopts">
	Numbler can import files generated by Microsoft&#174; Excel&#174; in either XML or XLS format.  CSV comma seperated value) files are also accepted.  CSV does not support formulas or spreadsheet formatting (cell color, column and row height, etc).  Export from Excel&#174; using XML if you have a choice.

  <item description="My spreadsheet has formula errors.  What's going on?" ref="failedimport">
	Sorry about that!  It may be that Numbler does not support a formula in your spreadsheet.  We are working daily to expand our list of formulas.
