Installation instructions:


make sure the appropriate packages are installed.  The following instructions
have been tested on ubunty edgy:

  * apt-get python-mysqldb rhino gnumeric libicu34-dev g++ python-dev 
    python-numpy python-numpy-ext python-twisted python-pyopenssl python-ply 
    python-setuptools python-xml python-celementtree python-egenix-mxdatetime 
    mysql-server openssl

  * download, compile, and install PyICU from http://pyicu.osafoundation.org/ 

  * checkout latest source code via:
    svn co http://numbler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

  * move the nevow subfolder to /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/nevow
    Nevow is web toolkit available at http://divmod.org.  unfortunately
    Numbler only works right now an older patched version.

  * create the numbler database.  By default the mysql username and password
    is ssdb/ssdb.  from the mysql prompt

    create database ssdb
    grant all privileges on ssdb.* to 'ssdb'@'localhost' identified by 'ssdb'

    cd to the server directory and run "python ssdb.py init"

  * move the numbler source folder to /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/numbler.
    You might want to create a soft link to this location, perhaps something
    like /var/www/numbler.

  * start the numbler server in debug mode.

    cd /var/www/numbler
    twistd -noy sheet.tac 

    it will fail the first time.  Follow the instructions to configure your crypto
    keys and run "twistd -noy sheet.tac"

    go to http://hostname:8080 to access your numbler install.  To run Numbler
    on port 80 run "twistd -noy sheetprod.tac."
